# pitch is off relative to jsxm; check sign of finetune/relnote?
# sometimes lags, particularly noticeable in mysong66.xm
 # avoid using actx.currentTime and instead pass along the time it's supposed to be as a starting point
# mixes too loud and clips
# Chrome mysteriously only plays the first note (row?)
# effects used in my music:
 # portamento down (0x02) (mysong77.xm)
  > parameter is Î”freq in 16ths of a semitone (32nds of a tone?) per tick
 # set note panning position (0x08) (mysong54.xm, mysong79.xm)
 # set song speed/BPM (0x0f) (mysong01c.xm, mysong70b.xm, stargate.xm)
 # arpeggio (0x00) (mysong00a.xm, I actually used this thinking it was the volume, I think)
# add row numbers to patterns
# scroll to and highlight pattern row currently playing
# allow loading new song without reloading the page
# fix clicks, very noticeable in mysong60.xm
 > BiquadFilterNode doesn't work, clicks are at all frequencies
# degenerate volume envelopes don't behave correctly (spooky00.xm instrument 6)
# more control over playing:
 # stop
 # loop
- add alternate input to fetch songs from a (CORS-enabled or local) URL
 - when there's a fragment ID after the xm-player.html URL, use it to fill that input, and automatically fetch
? render to wav/mp3/etc.
 - in a Data URI so user can save it
 - or just to get more accurate playback (but without scrolling the page because that would still be inaccurate and thus lose sync with the pre-rendered version)
? interpret effects in tooltips
 - include units whenever possible
- reorganize so that:
 - reading is separate from displaying
 - displaying uses appendChild as opposed to innerHTML+= more often
 - Channels keep note/effect state instead of PlayingNotes
 - Channels are always present, but not always in a note-on state
 - note-on-ness states are: sustained, released but still playing, not playing
 ? Channels in a playing state always have the same AudioNode graph, just different parameters (in non-playing state this can be freed)
 ? process per-tick instead of per-row (or can this really be accomplished by scheduling parameter changes within each row? I think probably not because some per-tick effects might interact with each other)
- panning envelopes
- envelope sustain/loop
? instrument vibrato

? all the remaining effects (prioritized by what I see used most in others' music)
