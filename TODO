# pitch is off relative to jsxm; check sign of finetune/relnote?
# sometimes lags, particularly noticeable in mysong66.xm
 # avoid using actx.currentTime and instead pass along the time it's supposed to be as a starting point
# mixes too loud and clips
# Chrome mysteriously only plays the first note (row?)
- effects used in my music:
 - portamento down (0x02) (mysong77.xm)
 # set note panning position (0x08) (mysong54.xm, mysong79.xm)
 # set song speed/BPM (0x0f) (mysong01c.xm, mysong70b.xm, stargate.xm)
 ? arpeggio (0x00) (mysong00a.xm, I actually used this thinking it was the volume, I think)
# add row numbers to patterns
# scroll to and highlight pattern row currently playing
? allow loading new song without reloading the page
? interpret effects in tooltips
# fix clicks, very noticeable in mysong60.xm
 > BiquadFilterNode doesn't work, clicks are at all frequencies
# degenerate volume envelopes don't behave correctly (spooky00.xm instrument 6)
- more control over playing:
 - stop
 - loop
