# pitch is off relative to jsxm; check sign of finetune/relnote?
- sometimes lags
# mixes too loud and clips
- Chrome mysteriously only plays the first note (row?)
- effects used in my music:
 - portamento down (0x02)
 - set note panning position (0x08)
 - set song speed/BPM (0x0f)
 ? arpeggio (0x00) (I actually used this thinking it was the volume, I think)
# add row numbers to patterns
# scroll to and highlight pattern row currently playing
? allow loading new song without reloading the page
